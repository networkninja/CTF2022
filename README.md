Network Ninja CTF 2022
==============================

Here are the challenges from the [Network Ninja 2022 Capture the Flag Contest](https://networkninja.com/blog/capture-the-flag-cybersecurity-part1/). You will need [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to run these challenges yourself.

These challenges involve exploiting poorly-written sudo rules. No vulnerabilities are implied in sudo, nor in the UNIX utilies to which privilege has been granted in the challenges. Needless to say, the rules shouldn't be used for anything other than this exercise - they're giant security risks.
